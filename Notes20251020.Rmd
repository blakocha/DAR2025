# Descriptive statistics in R

## The data

```{r}
library(googlesheets4)
gs4_deauth()
d <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I1ZJ4I345TfaHvyCCgzMz8pMsfS_J3yi9WcpcrhO6No/edit?usp=sharing", "clean_data")
```

## Distribution of one variable

### Central tendency and positional measures

- The arithmetic mean
- The median
- The mode (usually: the most frequent value)
- The geometric mean (we use it for example to calculate compound average annual rate of growth)
- [Truncated mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_mean)

Let us take `head_circ` and `fb_friends` variables from the data and calculate the mean, the median, the geometric mean, the truncated mean (cut 5\% from each tail).
