## The data

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(googlesheets4)
gs4_deauth()
d <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I1ZJ4I345TfaHvyCCgzMz8pMsfS_J3yi9WcpcrhO6No/edit?usp=sharing", "clean_data")
```

Let's construct a 95-percent CI (confidence interval) for the mean height. We assume the data we collected is a sample from the population of some students. And we ask ourselves what is the average height in the population. 

```{r}
mean(d$height)
test_result<-t.test(d$height, conf.level = 0.95)
print(test_result$conf.int)
```

The confidence interval for the average right hand span in the population (assume 99% confidence). 

The confidence interval for the average movies watching time in hours (`movies`). 

The confidence interval for the proportion of males in the group. 

The confidence interval for the correlation between the height and head size (`head_circ`).
