## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and/or MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com> or <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data.frame(x = 1:10, x.squared = (1:10)^2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## The chunk of code that is not executed:

```{r eval=FALSE} 
replicate(1e6,{cor(rnorm(1000), rnorm(1000))})
```

## LaTeX formulas:

The formula for the mean ($\bar{x}$) is the following:

$$  \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$
