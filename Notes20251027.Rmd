# Descriptive statistics in R - correlation / association

## The data

```{r}
library(googlesheets4)
gs4_deauth()
d <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I1ZJ4I345TfaHvyCCgzMz8pMsfS_J3yi9WcpcrhO6No/edit?usp=sharing", "clean_data")
```

## Pearson correlation coefficient

Measures the **linear** correlation between two quantitative (numeric) variables. See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)

Example: correlation between right and left hand span. 

```{r}
plot(d$right_hand_span, d$left_hand_span, pch=16)
cor(d$right_hand_span, d$left_hand_span)
```
